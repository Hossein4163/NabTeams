# Implementation Plan

## 1. Complete participant registration event integration
- Review and adjust participant wizard state hydration to ensure `eventId` persists when editing existing registrations.
- Guard initial event selection effect to avoid unnecessary re-renders when editing an existing record.
- Extend summary and validation messaging to surface the selected event.

## 2. Build participant task management UI
- Create `/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx` to list and manage tasks tied to a participant registration, including status updates and AI advice requests.
- Reuse API helpers for CRUD operations and wire in authentication context.
- Surface entry points from the participant registration dashboard after submission/finalization.

## 3. Polish admin events management experience
- Refine auth memoization and loading lifecycle on `/dashboard/admin/events`.
- Replace directional spacing classes to remain RTL-safe and add inline status/empty states.

## 4. Documentation and tests
- Update README and user guide with AI task manager instructions and admin configuration steps.
- Add backend unit tests for events and participant task controllers/services.
- Document limitations regarding lint/test execution when tooling is unavailable in this environment.

## 5. Final reporting
- Compile a comprehensive operational report summarizing the new task management capabilities, configuration steps, and testing notes for stakeholders.
